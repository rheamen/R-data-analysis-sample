# R-data-analysis-sample
R evaluation of a Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office recidivism program (RCT): cleaned and merged administrative datasets, engineered charge and re-arrest indicators, checked baseline balance, and estimated treatment effects.

I was given simulated administrative data from the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office to evaluate a one-year recidivism-reduction program in Chicago with randomized assignment to treatment and control. Using R, I:

Recoded race/ethnicity and summarized sample composition

Merged arrests with crime records and restricted to Chicago arrests

Created flexible charge indicators (e.g., homicide, weapons)

Reconstructed and validated the post-assignment re-arrest outcome

Tested baseline balance and produced a partner-ready visualization

Estimated the relationship between treatment assignment and re-arrest using statistical models

(Note: Data were generated/manipulated for assessment purposes and are not intended for real-world inference.)
